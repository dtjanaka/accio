# Accio

Accio aims to create a magic wand application to help users select and create masks of desired objects within images. 

Users will be able to submit images into projects, work on images the images by using our floodfill, scribblefill, paint brush, eraser, invert and other visual tools in order to create masks. The masks of the images can give an accurate and up-to-date representation of where the objects in the images reside for purposes such as machine learning, flood prediction, etc.

Accio was built with Maven using Java servlets and Angular.

The name Accio (AK-eee-oh) comes from the Harry Potter spell used to summon objects from a distance.
